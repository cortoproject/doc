# cortodoc
Cortodoc is an easy to use framework that generates HTML-based documentation from markdown files. An example of documentation generated by cortodoc can be found here: https://corto.io/doc/guide.html.

In addition to features provided by markdown, cortodoc comes with a number of custom features:

- highlight notes, warnings and console commands
- syntax highlighting for popular languages
- doxygen support
- code generation from corto model files

** This document is a work in progress. Some sections may refer to features that are not yet implemented, and some links may not yet work **

## Installation
[cortodoc installation instructions]

To install cortodoc, make sure that bake is installed, and the corto runtime and tool are installed to your machine. Try running the following commands on your machine to verify if you meet the prerequisites:

```
bake env
corto --version
```

If both commands run without errors, you can proceed with the cortodoc installation. If not, this command will install the prerequisites:

```
curl https://corto.io/install-bake | sh
```

Run the `bake` and `corto` commands again to verify that the installation was successful, and you can access both commands from the terminal.

Now, run this command to install cortodoc:

```
curl https://corto.io/install-cortodoc | sh
```

This will download and install the cortodoc repositories to your machine. After the installation is completed, you can start using cortodoc!

### Repositories
The cortodoc implementation can be found in the following repositories, in the cortoproject organization:

Repository | Description
-----------|-------------
[driver-tool-doc](https://github.com/cortoproject/driver-tool-doc) | The tool that is invoked when the `corto doc` command is ran
[driver-gen-doc-doxygen](https://github.com/cortoproject/driver-gen-doc-doxygen) | Doxygen to markdown generator
[driver-gen-doc-html](https://github.com/cortoproject/driver-gen-doc-html) | HTML generator for cortodoc objects
[driver-ext-md](https://github.com/cortoproject/driver-ext-md) | Markdown parser that stores markdown as cortodoc objects
[doc](https://github.com/cortoproject/doc) | Documentation for cortodoc

## Getting started
[quick start for new users]

To generate documentation, a markdown file is required first. Any markdown file can be parsed by cortodoc. The following command will generate HTML from a markdown file called `README.md`:

```demo
corto doc README.md
```

After the generation has completed, the directory in which the command was executed will now contain an `html` directory, which contains the generated HTML documentation.
